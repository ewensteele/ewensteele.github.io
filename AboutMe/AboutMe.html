                    I was done born. Very much enjoyed being born, grateful for my parents for not letting me die and feel 
                    particularly fortunate that they aren't aresholes. Thanks Mum & Dad.

                    Went to school for the first time, at the age of four. Had a very nice teacher when I was in Reception.

                    Got to go to big school with the big boys and girls. Classic awkward teenage years, did have a cool group
                    of friends though. Shame that I still see some of them, it's been far too long now and I really have had enough of 
                    them just being so good friends. What's a guy gotta do for some bad friends

                    Finished big school, did fairly well (could have done better) but I can't complain. Came out feeling mostly
                    lost and alone

                    Finished bigger school (college here) with some rather disappointing results. Reckon I could have been something
                    proper, but instead I did business. Who needs doctors or engineers.

                    Finally graduated university after four years, including one year placement at the same place what I do the work now.
                    With hindsight was a great experience, at the time didn't enjoy all of it. Played far too much hockey, usually about 4x a week.
                    Graduated with a 2:1, a little disappointing not a Geoff Hurst but ah well.

                    Got my first (technically second) proper job in the London, at the same place I did my placement. Has been pretty wild, I actually have some
                    different friends now, it's great. Also the rent is extortionate, yay. Guess who'll never buy a property on a single income? This guy (and my whole generation)!
